## Runtime

### Core (all platforms)

The shared calculation, conversion, financial, history, settings, and storage
logic in `src/cinqic_calculator/` has **no third-party runtime dependencies** —
it is pure Python standard library.

### Desktop (Windows, Linux)

| Component | License | Notes |

| [CPython](https://www.python.org/) | Python Software Foundation License 2.0 | Bundled into the packaged builds by PyInstaller. |
| [Tcl/Tk](https://www.tcl-lang.org/) | Tcl/Tk License (BSD-style) | Used via the standard library's `tkinter`; bundled into the packaged builds. |

The packaged Windows and Linux builds are produced with
[PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) (GPL-2.0-or-later **with** a bootloader
exception that explicitly permits distributing the resulting applications under
any license of your choosing). PyInstaller itself is a build tool and is not
distributed as part of the application; the bootloader it embeds is covered by
that exception.

### Android

Kivy, python-for-android, and their dependencies do not add any network,
analytics, or telemetry behaviour, and none is added by this application. The
Android app requests no permissions.

## Build and development only
