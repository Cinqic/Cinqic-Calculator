"""Android-app-only constants.

Kept separate from ``cinqic_calculator.constants`` because the Android app is
*packaged* independently (its own ``buildozer.spec``
``version``/``android.numeric_version``) and carries an Android
``versionCode`` that the desktop has no equivalent for.

Since 1.1.0 the two platforms share a single product version number, so
``ANDROID_APP_VERSION`` and ``constants.APP_VERSION`` are expected to match --
a test asserts they do not silently drift apart.
