"""Pure-Python glue between the platform-independent ``cinqic_calculator``

load time, on purpose: it is unit-tested directly (see
``tests/test_android_glue.py``) on a plain desktop interpreter that has no
Kivy or Android tooling installed at all. Any real *decision logic* the
Android screens need (memory-button enabled state, the persist-memory
toggle's clear-on-disable semantics, which screen currently owns hardware
key input, recording a calculation to history) belongs here, not inline in
a screen's ``.py``/``.kv`` file, precisely so it can be tested this way.

    Why this exists: the desktop v1.0.1 fix discovered that Tkinter

    keystrokes typed into a Financial/Convert entry field silently drive the
    hidden Calculator view's state. The fix was to guard every
    toplevel-bound handler on ``winfo_ismapped()``.

    Kivy's normal text input already avoids this class of bug: each
    screen's ``TextInput``/numeric-entry widgets are separate objects and
    only the focused one receives typed text, so there is no single shared
    "current expression" that other screens can accidentally mutate merely
    by being visible. The one place an equivalent leak *could* still creep
    in is a global ``Window``-level binding (hardware back button, a global
    keyboard-shortcut handler) that unconditionally forwards to the
    Calculator screen's ``Calculator`` instance regardless of which screen
    is actually active. Any such global binding must consult
    :meth:`is_active` before touching Calculator state - this class is that
    guard, kept as plain-Python decision logic so it's directly testable.
